# floimg-web Vault

Project documentation and architecture decisions for the floimg marketing site.

## Structure

```
vault/
├── architecture/    # Technical decisions and patterns
└── _meta/          # Conventions and guidelines
```

## Purpose

This vault contains evergreen documentation that describes how floimg-web works, why certain decisions were made, and conventions to follow.

Unlike ephemeral task tracking, vault documents should be written without temporal language ("will", "soon", "recently"). They describe the current state of the system.
