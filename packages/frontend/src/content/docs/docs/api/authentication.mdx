import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The FloImg API uses API keys for authentication. Each request must include your API key in the `Authorization` header.

## Getting Your API Key

1. Log in to [FloImg Studio Cloud](https://studio.floimg.com)
2. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Copy and securely store your key (it won't be shown again)

<Aside type="caution">
  API keys are secret. Never commit them to version control or expose them in client-side code.
</Aside>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` scheme:

```bash
curl https://api.floimg.com/v1/workflows \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fsk_live_abc123xyz789..."
```

## API Key Format

FloImg API keys follow this format:

| Prefix | Environment | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `fsk_live_` | Production | `fsk_live_abc123xyz789...` |
| `fsk_test_` | Test/Sandbox | `fsk_test_def456uvw012...` |

Test keys are rate-limited and don't consume your plan quota. Use them for development.

## Environment Variables

We recommend storing your API key in environment variables:

```bash
# .env
FLOIMG_API_KEY=fsk_live_abc123xyz789...
```

Then in your code:

```typescript
const apiKey = process.env.FLOIMG_API_KEY;
```

## Key Permissions

When creating an API key, you can scope its permissions:

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `workflows:read` | List and get workflow details |
| `workflows:execute` | Execute workflows |
| `storage:read` | List and download images |
| `storage:write` | Upload and delete images |
| `all` | Full access (default) |

## Revoking Keys

To revoke an API key:

1. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
2. Find the key to revoke
3. Click **Revoke**

Revoked keys immediately stop working. There's no undo.

## Error Responses

Authentication errors return `401 Unauthorized`:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "unauthorized",
    "message": "Invalid or missing API key"
  }
}
```

Common causes:
- Missing `Authorization` header
- Invalid or revoked API key
- Using a test key in production (or vice versa)

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never expose keys client-side** - API calls should go through your backend
2. **Rotate keys periodically** - Create new keys and revoke old ones
3. **Use least privilege** - Create keys with only the permissions needed
4. **Monitor usage** - Check your dashboard for unexpected activity
5. **Use test keys for development** - Avoid accidental production usage
