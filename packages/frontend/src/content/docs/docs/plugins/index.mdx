FloImg plugins add image generation capabilities to your workflows. Each plugin wraps a best-in-class library or service.

## Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

FloImg plugins are **thin wrappers** around amazing tools. We don't reimplement—we orchestrate.

**What this means for you:**
- **Full power** - Access 100% of the underlying library's capabilities
- **Native formats** - Use Chart.js config directly, not a FloImg abstraction
- **One source of truth** - Library docs are your docs; we link to them
- **Easy to learn** - If you know Chart.js, you already know floimg-quickchart

**Why we built it this way:**
- We're not trying to replace these amazing tools—we're grateful they exist
- Abstracting away capabilities would limit what you can do
- Maintaining parity with upstream libraries is unsustainable
- You shouldn't have to learn "FloImg's version" of Chart.js

FloImg handles the pipeline (generate → transform → save). The underlying libraries do what they do best.
