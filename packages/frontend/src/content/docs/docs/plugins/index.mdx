FloImg plugins add image generation capabilities to your workflows.

## How Plugins Work

Plugins are thin wrappers. They expose the underlying library's API directly—[no FloImg abstraction layer](/docs/plugins#how-plugins-work).

When you use `floimg-openai`, you're using OpenAI's API. When you use `floimg-mermaid`, you're writing Mermaid syntax. We don't invent our own config format or hide capabilities behind a "simpler" interface.

**Why this matters:**
- Their docs are your docs. We link to them, not duplicate them.
- If you already know DALL-E or Mermaid, there's nothing new to learn.
- Every feature the library supports, you can use.

FloImg handles the pipeline—generate, transform, save. The plugins handle generation by delegating to proven tools.
